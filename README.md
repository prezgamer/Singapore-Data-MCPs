```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "singapore-data": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/carpark_availability_MCP.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**

### With API Key (Optional)

For enhanced rate limits and features, you can use a data.gov.sg API key:

```python
# Modify the server initialization
carpark_system = SingaporeCarParkSystem(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

Get your API key from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/developer).

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can ask Claude to:

- *"Find available parking near Orchard Road"*
- *"What's the current availability at carpark ACB?"*
- *"Search for carparks in Jurong with availability"*
- *"Get complete information about carpark BM29"*
- *"Show me all carparks starting with 'TP'"*
- *"Find parking near Marina Bay Sands"*

## Data Sources

This server integrates with Singapore's official government data APIs:

- **Static Carpark Information**: `data.gov.sg/dataset/hdb-carpark-information`
- **Real-time Availability**: `data.gov.sg/dataset/carpark-availability`

## Development

### Running from Source

```bash
# Clone or download the server file
python singapore_carpark_server.py
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test individual functions
python -c "
from singapore_carpark_server import SingaporeCarParkSystem
system = SingaporeCarParkSystem()
print(system.fetch_carpark_info('ACB'))
"
```

### Logging

The server includes comprehensive logging. Set the log level in the code:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # For detailed logs
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)   # For normal operation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Ensure MCP is installed: `pip install mcp`
2. **No carpark found**: Check the carpark number format (usually 2-4 uppercase characters)
3. **Timeout errors**: The server includes built-in timeouts; try again or check network
4. **Rate limiting**: Add delays between requests or use an API key

### Performance Tips

- Use `include_availability=false` for faster searches when live data isn't needed
